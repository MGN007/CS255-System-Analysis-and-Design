System Analysis and Design Reflection

The DriverPass project focused on designing an online system to help students prepare for their driving exams. The client wanted a platform where users could take practice tests, schedule lessons, and track their progress. My job was to gather requirements, document them clearly, and design a system that met those needs.

I think I did especially well with organization and clarity throughout both projects. My Business Requirements Document had a solid Gantt chart and strong comparisons between development models. For Project Two, I’m proud of how professional the presentation turned out—my instructor said it was exemplary and easy to follow without technical jargon.

If I were to revise one thing, I’d reformat the “Assumptions and Limitations” section from Project One so each item is listed separately. That would make it easier to read and more polished.

When designing the system, I focused on convenience and accessibility since those were key client goals. I’ve learned that understanding user needs is just as important as the technical side. Going forward, I plan to rely more on feedback and diagrams early in the process to make sure designs stay user-focused and practical.
